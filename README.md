# Let's Play Memory Game

For this project, I decided to upgrade my JavaScript skills by creating a Memory Game.

This is the first version of the game. After getting some feedback on the game, I will improve it.

The game itself is built using HTML/CSS/JS, with a 60-30-10 design pattern for nice-looking colors. The overall game experience is better on desktop, but it is adapted for mobiles and tablets as well.

In the image below, you can see the desktop version.
